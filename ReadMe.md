## README for Getting and Cleaning Data Project Repository
####The purpose of this document is to explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
####List of the files in the Repository:
	a- run_analyis.R, Project Code developed
	b- average_data.txt, this is the desired output from the project
	c- CodeBook.md, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed to clean up the data
Explaination how to run each of these files will follow

#### a- run_analyis.R
	Following are the needed steps to run the needed script to obtain the desired output:
	1- Download from the internet the following dataset inside your R Home Directory, <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> 
	2- unzip the data to a new folder "UCI HAR Dataset"
	3- Run the run_analyis.R
 	4 - Two files will be created "average_data.txt" which is the desired project output, "merged_data.txt" which is the dataset created at step 4 and used for review



#### b- average_data.txt, this is the desired output from the project which is a tab delimeted file that can be easily opened by EXCEL , even it is readable by Notepad,data description is found at the Codebook.md



#### C-CodeBook.md, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed to clean up the data
